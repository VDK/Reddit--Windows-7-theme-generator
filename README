Iâ€™ve been a long time Redditor. I thought it would be awesome if you could automaticly download /r/EarthPorn as wallpapers. Windows 7 actually had the option of automaticaly downloading pictures from RSS feed. The default Reddit RSS feed needed a only a little tweaking.

Now you too can generate a .theme file here: href=http://veradekok.nl/win7theme/form.html . 

This lets my server generate the RSS feed. I don't actually know how mutch traffic this is going to generate. I might pull this project offline if it were to cost me anything.
