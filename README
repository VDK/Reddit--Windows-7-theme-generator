Iâ€™ve been a long time Redditor. Now 4 months ago a new subreddit has swept the floor with /r/pics an made us OD on a constant stream of high quality pictures. /r/EarthPorn soon was followed by /r/AlbumArtPorn, /r/AnimalPorn and many others.

I thought it would be awesome if you could have those pictures in rotation as your wallpaper, and soon found out Windows 7 actually had the option of powering a custom theme using a RSS feed.

I used the Reddit API to reformat the latest posts into the appropriate rss format and soon got it working. Now you too can get this working by simply downloading one of the appropriate .theme file.
