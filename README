 ! --- WARNING - NO NSFW FILTER - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK --- !

Iâ€™ve been a long time Redditor. Now 4 months ago a new subreddit has swept the floor with /r/pics an made us OD on a constant stream of high quality pictures. /r/EarthPorn soon was followed by /r/AlbumArtPorn, /r/AnimalPorn and many others.

I thought it would be awesome if you could have those pictures in rotation as your wallpaper, and soon found out Windows 7 actually had the option of powering a custom theme using a RSS feed.

I used the Reddit API to reformat the latest posts into the appropriate rss format and soon got it working. Now you too can get this working by simply downloading one of the appropriate .theme file.



#THINGS THAT NEED WORKING/TESTING ON
* having NSFW filter would be apropriate.
* the filetype is now determened by the extension on the URL this could be fixed by trying to find out the filetype in some other way. 
* imgur pics that aren't directly need more testing
* in theory it should be posible to have multiple reddits show up, but at the time of writing causes an error. Having too many subreddits linked into one causes reddit itself to crash, it seems.
* would be nice if Flickr pictures that aren't direct linke to could also be included.
