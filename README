Iâ€™ve been a long time Redditor. I thought it would be awesome if you could automaticly download /r/EarthPorn as wallpapers. Windows 7 actually had the option of automaticaly downloading pictures from RSS feed. The default Reddit RSS feed needed a only a little tweaking.

Now you too can generate a .theme file <a href=http://veradekok.nl/win7theme/form.html>here</a>. This lets my server generate the RSS feed. 

I don't actually know how mutch traffic this is going to generate. I might pull this project offline if it were to cost me anything.



#THINGS THAT NEED WORKING/TESTING ON
* the filetype is now determened by the extension on the URL this could be fixed by trying to find out the filetype in some other way. 
* imgur pics that aren't directly linked need more testing
* in theory it should be posible to have multiple reddits show up, but at the time of writing causes an error. Having too many subreddits linked into one causes reddit itself to crash, it seems.
* would be nice if Flickr pictures that aren't direct linke to could also be included.


== Update 10/12/12 ==

* NSFW filter implemented
* Created a .theme generator
